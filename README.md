# Nexus_with_powershell

Nexus Repository OSS is an open source repository that supports many artifact formats, including Docker, Java, and npm.
With the Nexus tool integration, pipelines in your toolchain can publish and retrieve versioned apps and their dependencies 
by using central repositories that are accessible from other environments.

This repository includes Powershell Scripts to UPload/Download files to the Repository.

The upload/download of files take place through proper authentication of user provided credentials.

Properties files are written to provide for more flexibilty of scripts.
